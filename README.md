# NASA SpaceApps 2021 Challenge

## About
This repository contains my contributions to a team (called [Ontelligence](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/ontologies-and-interactive-network-visualizations/teams/ontelligence/project)) in the [Ontologies and Internactive Network Visualizations challenge](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/ontologies-and-interactive-network-visualizations/details).

- The result of the two-day hackathon was [this visualization](https://wayward710.github.io/Ontelligence/Ontelligence/public/).
- [This is a video by another teammate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xEZGfqZdKojRw_BYw0Gyg0-nFbo1CCkx/view)
- The [team website is at this link](https://ontelligence.cloud/index.html) 
- The team's challenge was one of the global finalists (see image below)

My contribution consisted of conceptual modeling, concept diagram/map creation, ontology development, and general team tasks. 
Team discussions were had, and I worked with another ontology developer.

Given the volunteer nature of the activity, and while under need of opportunity, this repository is created in the hope of finding a work or study opportunity and thus may serve as a pointer from a resume.

## Relevant Product for future development 
I developed a preliminary [ontology / semantic model for the NASA Science Mission Directorate](). Images are viewable in the images tap. 
With support to develop and innovate, this can serve to support NASA SMD and data management therein. 

## How you can help
My participation was unfunded, and I would like formal support to develop the ontology for the NASA SMD (or other NASA departments/offices/data/content). 
If you find value in any of my work, please [contact me](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) and consider [donating](https://tinyurl.com/donateViaPayPalrr).
