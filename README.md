# NASA SpaceApps 2021 Challenge

This repository contains my contributions to a team (called [Ontelligence](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/ontologies-and-interactive-network-visualizations/teams/ontelligence/project)) in the [Ontologies and Internactive Network Visualizations challenge](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/ontologies-and-interactive-network-visualizations/details).

My contribution consisted of conceptual modeling, concept diagram/map creation, ontology development, and general team tasks. 
Team discussions were had, and I worked with another ontology developer.
